**Conversation Summary (Chat Style)**

**User:** Idea to run LLMs across multiple personal devices (laptops + Android). Goal is distributed computing for local LLM workloads, mainly for learning and experimentation.

**Assistant:** Asked clarifying questions around goals, workload type, models, Android role, networking, coordination, reuse of existing tools, interfaces, and failure tolerance.

**User:**

* Primary goal: learning and experimentation, not performance
* Prefer task-level parallelism, then agent-based decomposition
* Heterogeneous and quantized models are fine
* Android priority: UI + relay → tool-only → lightweight inference
* Start on LAN; mobile nodes may be unreliable
* Prefer existing schedulers/orchestrators
* Chat UI first, MCP server later
* Wants architecture + tech stack + explicit reuse guidance

**Assistant:** Proposed a distributed “cognition” architecture (not distributed inference):

* One coordinator node for planning, scheduling, routing, aggregation
* Laptop workers for inference and tools
* Android nodes as best-effort UI/relay/tool workers
* Explicit reuse of Ray, LangGraph, NATS, Redis, ChromaDB, Ollama/LM Studio
* REST + WebSocket UI, optional MCP server for IDEs
* Best-effort execution model
* Phased build plan

**User:** Requested a detailed, no-fluff prompt and implementation plan.

**Assistant:** Delivered a full JSON prompt defining goals, architecture, components, task flow, reuse vs. do-not-build rules, followed by a phased implementation plan from single-coordinator setup to MCP and Android integration.

**User:** Asked for a concise chat-style summary without redundancy.
